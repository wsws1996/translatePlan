## 7.7 Programmatic creation of @AspectJ Proxies

In addition to declaring aspects in your configuration using either `<aop:config>` or `<aop:aspectj-autoproxy>`, it is also possible programmatically to create proxies that advise target objects. For the full details of Springâ€™s AOP API, see the next chapter. Here we want to focus on the ability to automatically create proxies using @AspectJ aspects.

The class `org.springframework.aop.aspectj.annotation.AspectJProxyFactory` can be used to create a proxy for a target object that is advised by one or more @AspectJ aspects. Basic usage for this class is very simple, as illustrated below. See the javadocs for full information.

```java
// create a factory that can generate a proxy for the given target object
AspectJProxyFactory factory = new AspectJProxyFactory(targetObject);

// add an aspect, the class must be an @AspectJ aspect
// you can call this as many times as you need with different aspects
factory.addAspect(SecurityManager.class);

// you can also add existing aspect instances, the type of the object supplied must be an @AspectJ aspect
factory.addAspect(usageTracker);

// now get the proxy object...
MyInterfaceType proxy = factory.getProxy();
```
