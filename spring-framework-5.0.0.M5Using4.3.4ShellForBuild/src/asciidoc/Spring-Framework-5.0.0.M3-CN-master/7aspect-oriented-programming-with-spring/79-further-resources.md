## 7.9 Further Resources

More information on AspectJ can be found on the [AspectJ website](https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj).

The book *Eclipse AspectJ* by Adrian Colyer et. al. (Addison-Wesley, 2005) provides a comprehensive introduction and reference for the AspectJ language.

The book *AspectJ in Action, Second Edition* by Ramnivas Laddad (Manning, 2009) comes highly recommended; the focus of the book is on AspectJ, but a lot of general AOP themes are explored (in some depth).
